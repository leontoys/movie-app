Yes, you can use Chrome DevTools for mobile browser debugging. Here are the key steps to debug websites on mobile Chrome:

1. Enable USB debugging on your Android device in the Developer Options[7].

2. Connect your Android device to your development machine using a USB cable[7].

3. On your development machine, open Chrome and navigate to chrome://inspect#devices[7].

4. Ensure "Discover USB devices" is enabled[7].

5. Your Android device should appear in the list of remote targets. If it shows as "Offline," accept the USB debugging permission prompt on your device[3].

6. Open Chrome on your Android device and navigate to the website you want to debug[3].

7. On your development machine, you'll see the open tabs from your Android device. Click "Inspect" next to the desired tab[3].

8. A new DevTools instance will open, allowing you to debug the mobile website as if it were running on your desktop[3].

This method allows you to inspect elements, modify DOM and CSS, use the console, and access other DevTools features for your mobile site[2]. It's a powerful way to debug and optimize websites for mobile browsers, ensuring compatibility and performance across devices.
